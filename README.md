A program that simulates a positional game, such as the arithmetic progression game, between a given number of players.

- **class Token**:  An instance of this class will hold a number from 1 to m. Consider the case when a token may be blank, meaning that it can take the place of any number.
- **class Board**: An instance of this class will contain n tokens (you may consider the numbers from 1 to n).
- **class Player**: Each player will have a name. This class will implement the Runnable interface. In the run method the player will repeatedly extract one token from the board.
- **class Game**: Simulate the game using a thread for each player.

-On the run() method in **class Player**: I didn't managed to finish it.
